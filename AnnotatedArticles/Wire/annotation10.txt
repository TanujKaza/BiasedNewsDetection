Relevant Sentiment 
BJP : -0.521853
Atal Bihari Vajpayee : -0.551563
Prime Minister Narendra Modi : -0.336819
Rahul Gandhi : -0.306528

Possible Problems 
1. The entities seem to be getting a negative sentiment because the article rebukes these people for invoking Vajpayee's name for political gains. Vajpayee shouldn't get a negative sentiment but that's probably happening due to the negative sentiment dished out in the article.
