Relevant Entities :
Modi government - 0.0 (I would have expected the first paragraph to give it a positive sentiment.)
IPPB - 0.536709 (IPPB will leverage reach of 1.55 lakh post office branches to provide banking and financial service to people in rural area.)
MNREGA - 0.555305 (Now, the schemes like MNREGA will have benefits reaching the farmers and rural people directly without involving any middleman.)

Possible Problems : 
1. Modi should be given a positive sentiment but it's instead given to India Post Payments Bank. 
2. India Post Payments Bank and IPPB are treated as separate entities.
