Possible Problems
1. Giving Yogi a negative sentiment is quite strange in this article. The first paragraph itself gives it a negative sentiment
The sentence "Yogi Adityanath is leaving no stone unturned in realising PM Modi’s dream. " gives Yogi a negative sentiment, while the sentence "Yogi Adityanath is turning all stones in realising PM Modi’s dream." gives Yogi a positive sentiment. This is quite strange and could be an issue.
