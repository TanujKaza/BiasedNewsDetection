Seems like Barkha Dutt love for terrorist has no end. A month back she had created sympathy for terrorist Burhan Wani who was gunned down by the Indian Army. Burkha Dutt wasting no time had tweeted that Indian army had killed an innocent son of a school headmaster. She received severe criticism for supporting terrorist and projecting him as innocent. She had also ridiculed Indian army for killing a terrorist.

Certain section of media including TimesNow, NewsX and ZeeNews had indirectly opposed her stand and Arnab Goswami, the chief editor of TimesNow had attacked Barkha Dutt without taking her name calling them Pseudo Liberals and Pseudo Journals. This incident had almost led to a media war between the two anchors like never before.

Now Barkha Dutt has again posted a picture with a man who she claims to be her “Rescuer” in Kashmir during her recent visit. Barkha tweeted “For Kashmir curfew days & when car drivers refuse to go further- a scooty & a kind young man to the rescue in Budgam”

Immediately after her tweet, many tweeples have posted video of a man propagating violence in Kashmir comparing him as the same person giving ride to barkha Dutt. And this man is none other than Burhan Wani”™s successor and Hizbul Mujaheddin Terrorist Zakir Rashid. The pictures of the man look very much alike which has raised serious questions as to whether Barkha Dutt was given a ride by the terrorist himself.

It is saddening that a country”™s top journalist has been relentlessly sympathizing terrorists and creating a hatred environment in Kashmir. Hope there is thorough investigation this matter and proper action against those found guilty.
