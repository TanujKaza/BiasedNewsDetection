Relevant Sentiment 
don Dawood Ibrahim : -0.450192
Prime Minister Modi : 0.0
UN : -0.613279
US : -0.613279

Possible Problems
1. I'm unsure why US and UN get negative sentiments in the text. Could it be due to a possible association with a negative entity in the article?
2. Modi should have been given a positive sentiment as the article heavily praises the diplomacy of Modi.
